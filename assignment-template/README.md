After reading below you can initialize a project and get started. **Good luck**!

  

  

## Assignment background

  

  

  

The assignment is supposed to simulate a real world assignment that you might get from a client. A part of the website of American Express is outdated and we have the opportunity to create a modern new version of this mini site. Our designer has created a basic wireframe and your task is to create a simple yet effective mini site based on this wireframe. Feel free to add any features that might enhance the users experience on your mini site. The wireframe only serves as a base of the mini site. The prototype can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/31PMJDsKly6M9pABQj9wKa/Amex?page-id=0%3A1&type=design&node-id=1465-666&viewport=1696%2C-3996%2C0.5&t=cjcuTWyirXY2dOvD-1&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1465%3A666)

  

  

  

### Tech

  
You can use the framework or language that you feel most comfortable with. You will not be judged on the tech you use as long as it is realistic to use in a real world scenario.

  

### Data

  

  

Some data can be fetched from the following url: `https://kendew-mock-api.vercel.app/api/assignment-data`. This API contains some mock data to query for your mini site. The API will return less data then you might need to fill the mini site. Feel free to use placeholder images and lorem ipsum for missing data. Or gather some data from the website of [American Express](https://www.americanexpress.com/nl-nl/). The template includes a typescript file that resembles the returned data. Feel free to use this file to work through the data more efficiently. In addition to this API a slug based dynamic API route is available: `https://kendew-mock-api.vercel.app/api/assignment-data/[slug]`. You can also decide to gather the information from the amex website yourself if you prefer. It is not mandatory to use these API endpoints, although it might make you life easier.

  

  

  

### Template files

  

  

To help you get going a couple things have been setup for you.

  

  

  

- A basic `globals.css` containing a `:root`. The colors and some other brand values you need have already been added to this file. Feel free to add any variables you might need to this root or create an additional root.

  

  

- A `response-data.ts` file has been setup to help you with a typesafe data query. It is not mandatory to use this file, you can delete it if you do not wish to use typescript.

  

  

- Placeholder images in two sizes.

  

  

  

### Rules

  

  

  

1. No tailwind. We want to see your (S)CSS skills so for this assignment no tailwind is allowed. SASS is allowed as well as the use of (S)CSS modules.

  

  

2. No component libraries. You will not be judged on accessibility and this is not a design position. We are interested in the code you write, not the code from some library.

  

### What we are looking for

We are looking for a simple codebase that is easy to expand on. Write the code in a way that is easy to understand an supported with comments to explain what you are doing. It is totally fine to use google, stack overflow or AI assistance. As long as you can answer questions about the code you wrote.KendeKend

Keep in mind that there is no right or wrong way to go about this assignment. We do not have a specific solution in mind, we just want to see how you handle this challenge.
